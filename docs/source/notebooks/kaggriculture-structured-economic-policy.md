# Kaggriculture: Structured Economic Policy

Terminal bank is the common unit for every decision. Productive
assets matter only through the cash-conversion chain

$$
B_0
\longrightarrow K_t
\longrightarrow Y_t
\longrightarrow Z_t
\longrightarrow B_T,
$$

where $K_t$ is committed capital, $Y_t$ is physical output, and
$Z_t$ is liquidatable stock across the shed and carried inventories.
With 24 turns per day,

$$
T=720,
\qquad d_t=\left\lfloor\frac{t}{24}\right\rfloor,
\qquad h_t=t-24d_t.
$$

For seat $p\in\{0,1\}$, the terminal objective is

$$
\max_\pi\;\mathbb E_\pi
\!\left[B_T^{(p)}-B_T^{(1-p)}\right].
$$

Three invariants govern the allocation:

1. irreversible losses precede optional growth;
2. field commitments precede market commitments;
3. every commitment must remain terminally feasible: maturity,
   harvest, return, and sale all fit before $T$.

## 1. Causal ledger

One turn contains two ordered controllable ledgers. Let $a_t^F$
denote field actions and $a_t^M$ market orders. Their ordered
subtransition is

$$
s_t^{\mathrm{post}}
=\mathcal M\!\left(
  \mathcal F(s_t,a_t^F),a_t^M
\right).
$$

Town demand and the scheduled observation refresh then map
$s_t^{\mathrm{post}}$ to $s_{t+1}$. These exogenous updates cannot
reverse the field-before-market precedence.

Dropped stock can become sale-eligible in the same turn because
$\mathcal F$ precedes $\mathcal M$. The reverse implication is
invalid: same-turn purchases cannot fund planting, feeding, or
watering already resolved by $\mathcal F$.

Field planning cannot use any same-turn market proceeds:

$$
B_t^F=B_t.
$$

Market planning processes the ordered sale list before later capital
orders. It discounts projected proceeds and upper-bounds purchase
cost:

$$
B_t^M
=B_t
 +0.85\sum_{s\in\mathcal S_t}\widehat R_t(s)
 -\sum_{b\in\mathcal B_t}\overline c_t(b).
$$

Thus a market sale may fund a later market order, but never a field
action already resolved by $\mathcal F$.

## 2. Production value

A crop occupying one tile for $g_c$ days has discounted value

$$
V_c(t)=
\Pr(\text{service completed})\,
y_c\,\widehat p_c(t+g_c)
-s_c-\lambda_W w_c-\lambda_L g_c.
$$

Here $s_c$ is seed cost, $w_c$ is required service, and $\lambda_W$
and $\lambda_L$ are the shadow prices of labor and land. Planting is
admissible only when maturity and liquidation remain feasible:

$$
t+24g_c+\tau_c^{\mathrm{harvest}}
+\tau_c^{\mathrm{return}}<T.
$$

Livestock uses the same opportunity-cost principle. For species
$a$ producing item $r(a)$,

$$
V_a(t)=
\sum_{\substack{u\in\mathcal P_a\\t\le u<T}}
  \gamma^{u-t}
  \Pr(\text{fed at }u)\,
  y_{a,u}\widehat p_{r(a)}(u)
-c_a-\lambda_P-\lambda_W w_a.
$$

Here $\mathcal P_a$ is the set of scheduled production turns;
non-production turns contribute no revenue.

Feed, second-miss water, terminal harvest, and terminal unloading
receive lexicographic protection. Growth uses only the residual
service capacity.

## cell [6] — markdown

## 3. Roles, jobs, and matching

Land geometry first creates spatial roles: crop service, livestock
service, inventory transport, and flexible support. Mission creation
converts urgency, loss risk, maturity, and terminal feasibility into
a discrete priority $p_j$ and an economic value $v_j$.

$$
S_{ij}=b_{p_j}+v_j-8d_1(x_i,x_j),
$$

where the priority bonuses are strictly ordered:

$$
(b_{-1},b_0,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4,b_5)
=(120000,100000,1500,750,250,0,-100).
$$

A pair is admitted only if the unit can reach the mission before its
deadline, the required carried item exists, the destination remains
legal, and terminal return is feasible. Candidate pairs are sorted
by descending $S_{ij}$, then distance and stable indices. Each unit
and each mission is consumed at most once. Inventory shadows are
updated immediately after assignment, so later pairs cannot spend an
item already committed by an earlier pair.

## cell [7] — markdown

## 4. Workload-responsive labor

Let $H_t$ be hired hands, $U_t=1+H_t$ the total field units,
$J_t$ the due jobs, and $R_t$ the assets exposed to a second missed
service. The desired number of hired hands is

$$
H_t^*=\min\!\left(
  \overline H(d_t),
  \max\!\left[
    H_t^{\mathrm{floor}},
    \left\lceil\frac{J_t+2R_t}{7}\right\rceil
  \right]
\right),
$$

with the maturity-dependent ceiling

$$
\overline H(d_t)=
\begin{cases}
12,&d_t<20,\\
13,&d_t\ge20.
\end{cases}
$$

The zero-based condition $d_t\ge20$ begins on displayed Day 21.
The workload floor is ten while productive roles remain active
through $d_t=27$, and four otherwise. On the terminal day, hours
zero and one use the separate recovery target

$$
H_t^{\mathrm{terminal}}
=\min\!\left(8,J_t^{\mathrm{terminal}}\right).
$$

Labor cost is convex:

$$
F_0=F_1=1,
\qquad F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2},
\qquad C(H)=\sum_{n=0}^{H-1}F_n.
$$

In particular,

$$
C(12)=376,
\qquad C(13)=609,
\qquad C(13)-C(12)=F_{12}=233.
$$

Before displayed Day 21, this marginal wage competes with land,
livestock, feed, and crop capital. After the recurring production
system has matured, the thirteenth hand is available only when the
job ledger and protected residual cash both justify its throughput.

Ordinary hiring requires both workload and residual market liquidity:

$$
h_t\le2,
\quad H_t<H_t^*,
\quad B_{t,k}^{M,\mathrm{res}}\ge\max(20,3F_{H_t}),
\quad |\mathcal M_t|<10.
$$

Terminal recovery is admitted separately when

$$
h_t\le1,
\quad H_t<H_t^{\mathrm{terminal}},
\quad B_{t,k}^{M,\mathrm{res}}\ge F_{H_t}+20,
\quad |\mathcal M_t|<10.
$$

## 5. Shared-market dynamics

Let $I_{r,t}$ be public inventory for product $r$, $D_{r,t}$ total
purchases, $S_{r,t}^{+}$ inventory-accreting sales, and $C_{r,t}$
town consumption. A sold unit contributes to $S_{r,t}^{+}$ only
when its clearing price exceeds the one-dollar floor.

$$
I_{r,t+1}=I_{r,t}+S_{r,t}^{+}-D_{r,t}-C_{r,t}.
$$

A unit sold at the floor still earns one dollar and leaves private
stock, but it does not increase public market inventory.

The marginal price is a rounded monotone inventory curve around
equilibrium $I_{0,r}$:

$$
p_r(I)=\max\!\left(1,\operatorname{round}\widetilde p_r(I)\right),
\qquad
\widetilde p_r(I)=
\begin{cases}
b_r+\alpha_r^- f_r^-(I_{0,r}-I),&I<I_{0,r},\\
b_r-\alpha_r^+ f_r^+(I-I_{0,r}),&I\ge I_{0,r}.
\end{cases}
$$

Purchases follow the projected unitwise marginal curve. Sales
contribute only $85\%$ of their projected proceeds to the planning
ledger. The haircut reduces financing risk; residual mismatch is
handled by unitwise partial fill.

## cell [9] — markdown

## 6. Price impact and the symmetry of order timing

Sales are filled unit by unit along the inventory curve, so a block of
$x$ units sold from inventory $I$ realises

$$
R(x\mid I)=\sum_{i=0}^{x-1}p_r(I+i),
\qquad
\delta_r(J)=p_r(J)-p_r(J+1)\ \ge 0 .
$$

Consider a counterparty whose block of $q$ units is committed in advance,
so its size does not react to price, and suppose we place $x$ units
immediately before it. Relative to placing our units after the block, the
two banks move by

$$
\Delta_{\text{ours}}=R(x\mid I)-R(x\mid I+q),
\qquad
\Delta_{\text{theirs}}=R(q\mid I)-R(q\mid I+x).
$$

Telescoping each difference over the intervening units gives the same
rectangle of marginal price steps,

$$
\Delta_{\text{ours}}
=\sum_{i=0}^{x-1}\sum_{j=0}^{q-1}\delta_r(I+i+j)
=\Delta_{\text{theirs}} .
$$

The advantage we take is therefore exactly the concession we impose, and
the objective of §1 moves by

$$
\Delta\!\left[B_T^{(p)}-B_T^{(1-p)}\right]
=2\sum_{i=0}^{x-1}\sum_{j=0}^{q-1}\delta_r(I+i+j).
$$

The factor two is the whole content of order timing against a
non-reacting block: the swing is twice the price impact, and it is
computable in closed form from the curve alone, with no simulation.

## cell [10] — markdown

## 7. Where the curve bites

The margin swing above is governed by $\delta_r$, not by the block size
alone. Because the curve is assembled from a different shape on each side
of the equilibrium inventory,

$$
\delta_r(J)\approx
\begin{cases}
\alpha_r^-\,\dfrac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dJ}f_r^-(I_{0,r}-J), & J<I_{0,r},\\[2ex]
\alpha_r^+\,\dfrac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dJ}f_r^+(J-I_{0,r}), & J\ge I_{0,r},
\end{cases}
$$

the same product can be nearly inelastic on one side and violently
elastic on the other. A logarithmic side flattens as it extends,
$\mathrm df^{-}/\mathrm dJ\to0$; a quadratic side steepens without bound,
$\mathrm df^{+}/\mathrm dJ\propto (J-I_{0,r})$.

The consequence is operational. Town consumption drains inventory
continuously, so a season spends most of its length *below* equilibrium.
A block that appears decisive when priced at $I_{0,r}$ can be worth two
orders of magnitude less at the inventory the season actually reaches.
Plans are therefore evaluated on the realised inventory path
$\{I_{r,t}\}$, never at the reference point.

## 8. The objective is a difference, not a level

Let $\mathcal H\subset\{0,\dots,T-1\}$ be a window over which we withhold
$\Delta z$ units of product $r$ that would otherwise have been sold. The
inventory path over that window is uniformly lower, hence the price path
is uniformly higher:

$$
I_{r,t}^{\text{hold}}\le I_{r,t},
\qquad
p_r\!\left(I_{r,t}^{\text{hold}}\right)\ \ge\ p_r\!\left(I_{r,t}\right)
\quad\text{for all } t\in\mathcal H .
$$

Every seat trading in $\mathcal H$ is paid on that same elevated path. If
the counterparty moves $v^{(1-p)}$ units through the window against our
$v^{(p)}$, the first-order effect on the objective is

$$
\Delta\!\left[B_T^{(p)}-B_T^{(1-p)}\right]
\;\approx\;
\left(v^{(p)}-v^{(1-p)}\right)\cdot
\overline{\Delta p_r},
$$

so withholding is a transfer *to* the counterparty whenever it is the
larger supplier in that window, however much it raises our own bank.

Two consequences shape the policy. First, maximising $B_T^{(p)}$ and
maximising the difference are distinct problems, and a change that
improves the first can worsen the second. Second, the marginal value of
any timing decision depends on the other seat's volume in the same
window, which is observable only through the public inventory path — so
sizing is computed against $\{I_{r,t}\}$ rather than against our own
holdings alone.

## cell [13] — markdown

## 9. Execution invariants

The final decision satisfies

$$
|a_t^{\mathrm{field}}|\le N_t^{\mathrm{units}},
\qquad
|a_t^{\mathrm{market}}|\le10.
$$

State resets are keyed by seat, board size, clock, and decreasing
canonical turn. Exceptions, malformed observations, and unsupported
configurations return the ordinary action already computed for that
turn.

## 10. Deterministic season path

Fix the game specification, seed $217$, seat $0$, and the starter
rule in seat $1$. The resulting path is

$$
\tau_{217}=\operatorname{Run}(\pi,\pi_{\mathrm{starter}};
217,0).
$$

With 24 turns per displayed day, frame $d\in\{1,\ldots,30\}$ uses

$$
i_d=\min(24d-1,719).
$$

Each frame joins the spatial farm state, productive inventory,
bank trajectories, normalized marginal prices, service events, and
the active control phase. Holding each daily state for $1.5$ seconds
gives a $45$-second cycle without changing the simulated clock.

## 11. Within-day routing

Displayed Day 21 is the first day with the expanded labor ceiling.
For hour $h\in\{0,\ldots,23\}$, the routing state is

$$
\mathcal R_h=
\left(X_h,A_h,J_h,Z_h,M_h\right),
$$

where $X_h$ contains unit positions, $A_h$ issued field actions,
$J_h$ pending jobs, $Z_h$ carried and shed inventories, and $M_h$
simultaneous market orders. Feasibility follows

$$
A_h(i)\in\mathcal A_i(X_h,J_h,Z_h),
\qquad
\sum_j\mathbf 1[A_h(i)=j]\le1.
$$

Frame-to-frame continuity checks that collection changes carried
stock before a later application and that unavailable operation
families remain absent rather than inferred. One second per hourly
frame gives a $24$-second cycle.
