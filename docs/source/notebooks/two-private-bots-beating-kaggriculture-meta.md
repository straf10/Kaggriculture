# The Two Private Bots Beating Kaggriculture's Public Meta

Three of Kaggriculture's top-5 teams share **the exact same opening** — down
to individual seed counts and hire numbers. It's the current public reference
agent, and it puts a hard ceiling on the ELO band at 3,117 – 3,131.

Above that ceiling sit two teams. Neither runs anything public. Their opening
signatures don't match any known notebook. And they're the current rank-1 and
rank-2 on the leaderboard.

This notebook maps the three strategy clusters at the top of Kaggriculture,
based on structured extraction of 15 recent episode replays (3 per top-5
team). The underlying data is in the companion dataset:
[Cracking Kaggriculture's Top-5: Opening-Move Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/revanthtambisetty/kaggriculture-top-player-opening-fingerprints).

Snapshot date: **2026-08-09**.

## Update — v25 validates the sheep-first cluster (same day)

A few hours after this notebook was published, kaitofukami released
[v25 "Meta Reset"](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaitofukami/15-16-strict-future-v25-meta-reset).
The opening line of their own description:

> The public v23 opening now appears in 22/30 current Top-30 teams. This update
> moves to a **different sheep-first basin.**

**v25 is the public sheep-first strategy** — the same cluster this analysis
identifies as `sheep_first_hybrid`. Their holdout evaluation reports **41/41 wins
against the v23-fork cluster**, which is exactly what the 3-cluster picture
predicts: the private edge HealthStone had is now becoming public.

Expect the ~3,130 ELO ceiling to shift as v25 forks spread over the next
few days.

## The three clusters

| Cluster | Teams | Ladder | Day-0 signature |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| **`v23_fork`** | three top-5 teams | 3,117 – 3,131 | 5 hires · 2 cows + 2 sheep · 7 wheat / 12 melon seeds · 0 strawberry |
| **`sheep_first_hybrid`** | HealthStone (rank #2) | 3,132.9 | **3 hires · 1 cow + 4 sheep** · 5 wheat / 5 melon seeds · sheep-first buys |
| **`counter_meta`** | Seb (rank #1) | 3,201.1 | **14 hires** · 3 cows + 2 sheep · 14 wheat / 3 melon seeds · aggressive labor |

Three of the top-5 teams share an identical opening signature (down to seed counts).
That's the current public meta agent, [kaitofukami v23](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaitofukami/23-23-strict-future-v23-sparse-closed-loop),
which several teams are running.

The remaining two teams — HealthStone (rank #2) and Seb (rank #1) — do
something structurally different. Their opening signatures don't match any
public notebook I'm aware of. They also happen to be the two teams beating
the shared public meta.

## Cash trajectory tells the story

The clearest way to distinguish the clusters is the average cash on hand in the
first 5 in-game days (averaged over 3 episodes per team):

| Day | HealthStone | Seb (counter_meta) | v23_fork family |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 3,000 | 3,000 | 3,000 |
| 1 | 14 | 562 | 22 |
| 2 | 14 | 353 | 22 |
| 3 | 18 | 656 | 152 |
| 4 | 26 | 481 | 417 |
| 5 | 214 | 766 | 694 |

Read that column-by-column:

- **HealthStone** front-loads absolutely everything — cash hits ~$14 by day 1
  and stays there for four days. They're clearly betting on `CARE` compounding
  from a heavily sheep-weighted herd (sheep-interval = 3 days, so `CARE`
  banks +3 per yield vs cow's +1). Every wheat-buy in the first week is
  survival, not accumulation.
- **Seb** keeps a real cash cushion throughout the opening — averaging $500+
  during days 1-5. That funds their eventual 4-quadrant expansion.
- **The v23_fork cluster** is in between: broke on days 1-2, then rebuilding.
  Textbook staged opening.

**Same starting cash. Three completely different strategies for spending it.**

## Final-state comparison

By end of game the three clusters diverge sharply:

| | v23_fork family | HealthStone | Seb |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Land quadrants | 3 | 3 | **4** |
| Cows | 8 | 8 | 9 |
| Sheep | 6 | **4** | **11** |
| Total animals | 14 | 12 | 20 |
| Avg final coins | ~$100k | ~$100k | ~$57k in these games (but rank-1 across the ladder) |

Seb's counter-meta looks like a strict *bigger* build — more land, more animals.
Their per-game final coins in the sampled episodes are smaller, but they win
on the ladder because they beat the public v23-fork cluster consistently.

HealthStone runs the smallest herd of the three (12 animals vs 14 vs 20) but
matches the v23-fork on final coins. That's efficiency: fewer animals, better
`CARE` compounding, more crop cycles.

## Reproduce the analysis

The full underlying tables (`openings_summary.csv`, `openings_actions.csv`,
`openings_clusters.csv`) are in the companion dataset
[Cracking Kaggriculture's Top-5: Opening-Move Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/revanthtambisetty/kaggriculture-top-player-opening-fingerprints).
Attach it to any notebook and load with:

```python
import pandas as pd
summary  = pd.read_csv("/kaggle/input/kaggriculture-top-player-opening-fingerprints/openings_summary.csv")
clusters = pd.read_csv("/kaggle/input/kaggriculture-top-player-opening-fingerprints/openings_clusters.csv")

cols = [c for c in summary.columns if c.endswith("_first48")]
summary.groupby("team")[cols].mean().round(1)
```

## Why this matters if you're competing

**Detection.** The first-48-turn observations of any opponent are enough to
identify which cluster they belong to. `openings_actions.csv` in the companion
dataset has the raw action stream if you want to build a live matcher.

**Where the edge is.** Between the three clusters:

- **v23_fork:** replicable — copy the public reference. Score band ~3,117–3,131.
- **sheep_first_hybrid:** requires a redesign around `CARE` compounding on
  sheep. The visible early-game cash constraint ($14 for 4 days) is severe,
  which likely explains why fewer teams run it. If you can survive it,
  HealthStone's numbers suggest it's slightly above the public reference.
- **counter_meta:** requires funding 4 land quadrants and 20 animals. The
  cash trap is real (I hit variants of it four times when I tried building
  toward it heuristically); execution has to be tight.

**What v23 misses.** The public reference is calibrated for a symmetric
opponent. Against HealthStone or Seb it loses in the sampled data — those two
teams are the ones sitting above it on the ladder. Reproducing either private
strategy is the natural next research direction for anyone chasing top-2.

## Method

For each of the current top-5 teams on 2026-08-09:

1. Pulled the team's highest-scoring active submission via
   `kaggle competitions team-submissions <team_id>`.
2. Downloaded 3 recent episode replays via
   `kaggle competitions replay <episode_id>`.
3. Extracted the target player's actions from the first 48 steps of each replay.
4. Aggregated into per-episode summary rows and a long-format action log.
5. Classified into clusters by comparing the resulting opening signatures.
   The `v23_fork` classification is verified by running v23 locally in
   self-play and confirming byte-identical opening actions.

All raw data is in the companion dataset. Underlying episode replays are
public via [kaggle/kaggriculture-episodes-index](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/kaggriculture-episodes-index).
