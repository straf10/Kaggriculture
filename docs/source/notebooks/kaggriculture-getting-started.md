# Kaggriculture Tutorial

Farm your way to market dominance! Players harvest produce and animal products to sell in a dynamic market.

## Game Mechanics 
 
- **Farmer**: takes one action per turn over a season with 30 days and 24 turns per day (720 total).
- **Crops and animals**: each have their own seed cost, time to first yield, and total payout. 
- **Daily care**: plants need watering every day or they turn to weeds, animals need feeding or they escape.
- **Market prices**: move with supply, selling a product pushes its price down, and crops vary in how hard they crash from a glut.
- **Town shops** unlock over the season and steadily buy products, lifting prices over time.
- **Farm hands** can be hired for the day, with increasing costs for each hire per day. 
- **Farm expansion**: start with one quadrant of land and can buy the other three for an escalating fee.
- **Shed**: holds harvested goods but caps at 100 items, anything past that is discarded at end of day.
 - **Win condition**: whoever has the most money in the bank at the end of the season wins.

## Understanding the Observation

Each turn your agent receives an observation with:

- **`player`** — your player id (`0` or `1`).
- **`day`** / **`hour`** — the current in-game day (0-indexed) and turn within that day (0-indexed; there are `turnsPerDay` turns per day).
- **`farms`** — a list of both players' public farm state, indexed by player id. Each farm has:
    - `money` — current bank balance
    - `tiles` — a `boardSize × boardSize` grid indexed `tiles[y][x]`; each cell is `None` (empty), `"LOCKED"` (unowned quadrant), or a dict describing a `PLANT`, `WEED`, `COOP`, or `PASTURE` (see below)
    - `farmer` — `[x, y]` position of your main farmer
    - `hands` — `[x, y]` positions of any hired hands active today
    - `unlocked_quadrants` — subset of `["NW", "NE", "SW", "SE"]`
    - `hires_today` — number of hires already made today (drives the next `HIRE` price)
- **`market`** (shared) — `inventory` and current `prices` per product (`WHEAT, CARROT, TOMATO, STRAWBERRY, MELON, EGG, MILK, WOOL, FERTILIZER`).
- **`town`** (shared) — `unlocked_shops`, the list of shops currently generating per-tick demand.
- **`private`** — your own hidden state (not visible to your opponent):
  - `shed` — counts of every product and animal (`GOOSE`, `COW`, `SHEEP`) stored in your shed
  - `seeds` — seed counts per crop
  - `inventories` — per-unit carried inventories; `[0]` is your main farmer, `[1..]` are today's hired hands in order

Tile dicts come in a few shapes:

- **Plant**: `{kind: "PLANT", crop, planted_day, watered_today, consecutive_unwatered, yield_units, max_lifespan_step, fertilized_until_day}` — `consecutive_unwatered >= 2` turns the tile to a weed at end of day.
- **Weed**: `{kind: "WEED"}` — must be `DIG`-ed before the tile is usable again.
- **Coop / Pasture** (empty): `{kind: "COOP" | "PASTURE"}`.
- **Coop / Pasture** (occupied): adds `animal, placed_day, yield_units, fed_today, consecutive_unfed, cared_today, fertilizer_available, pending_care_bonus`. `consecutive_unfed >= 2` means the animal escapes.

Your agent returns a dict of actions for the farmer, any farm hands, and the market: `{"farmer": 'PASS', "hands": [], "market": []}`

## Agent 1: Melon Maxxer

Our first agent is straightforward:
1. Whenever it runs out of melon seeds and has the cash, buy one more.
2. Walk to the nearest open tile and plant a melon; if it's already standing on a melon plant, water it (or harvest it once it's fully grown).
3. Once melons pile up in the shed, only sell them if the market price is above a threshold, otherwise hold and wait for a better price.
4. Roll the proceeds back into more seeds and repeat.

This demonstrates the core aspects of the game: reading observations, maintaining the farm, and watching the market.

## What's wrong with this agent?

The melon agent has a few problems:
  - It never hires farm hands or buys more land, so it's stuck with one farmer working a single quadrant.     
  - It only grows melons, so when other crops are fetching a higher price it has nothing to sell.
  - It never fertilizes its plants, leaving a yield bonus on the table.                           
  - When it does sell, it dumps the entire inventory in one order, which can crash the melon price below the       
  threshold partway through the sale.                                                                         
                                      
Now it's your turn to make improvements!

## Making a submission

You can either submit a main.py, a tar.gz (or zip) with a main.py in it, or submit a notebook with a main.py or submission.tar.gz

There are three ways to subit.
1. using the [Submit Agent](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggriculture-gdm-internal) button on the homepage and uploading the file
2. using the Kaggle CLI (as described in agents.py in the competition dataset)
3. submitting a notebook with a submission.py or submission.tar.gz
