# Kaggriculture: What the Top Farms Do — a Live Meta Guide

**A beginner-friendly guide to the Kaggriculture engine + a live tracker of what
top-ladder agents are actually doing, re-run daily on the official replay dataset.**

Two things in one notebook:
1. **Teach the mechanics that decide the game** — crop economics, yield curves,
   the price cliff, why everyone meters sales. (No ML background needed.)
2. **Track the meta** — infer the collective strategy (herd, crops, hiring, land,
   sell timing) from the top episodes, and slice the ladder any way you like.

> Data: official daily replays — [kaggriculture-episodes-index](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/kaggriculture-episodes-index)
> "ranked by average agent rating, capped at 20 GiB/day."
>
> Jump to the [§9 Summary](#summary) for the key takeaways and the daily workflow.

## 1. Setup

Every number in this notebook is computed from an **embedded copy of the
competition engine's market model** — `kaggle-environments` **1.32.x**, the
version the official replays record. Kaggle notebook images sometimes install a
newer build with different market math (the strawberry price cliff is **62
units** in 1.32.x but ~247 in other builds), which would silently corrupt every
teaching figure. Embedding the reference keeps the notebook correct and
reproducible everywhere — no pip installs, no restarts. The check at the bottom
just tells you whether the installed engine agrees.

# =====================================================================
# Competition engine reference — kaggle-environments 1.32.x market model
# =====================================================================
# Official replays record module_version 1.32.2; the 1.32.x line shares the
# same market math (verified: strawberry cliff = 62 units everywhere in 1.32.x).
# Some Kaggle notebook images ship a NEWER build whose market math differs
# (strawberry cliff ~247 units). We embed the 1.32.x model so every number in
# §2-§4 matches the actual competition, in any environment, without pip or
# restarts. (Production constants — crops, animals — are stable across these
# versions.)

## 2. What each crop pays (at base prices)

Profit per tile-day drives every planting decision. One-shot crops earn once;
ongoing crops earn repeatedly but slow. Here is the honest economics.

## cell [4] — code

```python
def one_shot_units(crop):
    c = CROPS[crop]
    window = range((c["max_yield_day"] + 1) // 2, c["max_yield_day"] + 1)
    return min(c["max_yield"], 1 + len(list(window)))

def ongoing_days(crop):
    c = CROPS[crop]
    return [c["first_yield_day"] - 1 + k * c["interval"] for k in range(c["max_yield"])]

def crop_econ():
    rows = []
    for crop, c in CROPS.items():
        if c["ongoing"]:
            days = ongoing_days(crop)
            units, occupied = c["max_yield"], days[-1] + 2
        else:
            units, occupied = one_shot_units(crop), c["max_yield_day"]
        revenue = units * BASE[crop]
        profit = revenue - c["seed"]
        rows.append({"crop": crop, "seed $": c["seed"], "tile-days": occupied, "units": units,
                     "base price": BASE[crop], "revenue $": revenue, "profit $": profit,
                     "profit / tile-day": round(profit / occupied, 1)})
    return pd.DataFrame(rows).sort_values("profit / tile-day", ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)

econ = crop_econ()

bars = ax.barh(econ["crop"][::-1], econ["profit / tile-day"][::-1],
               color=[CROP_C[c] for c in econ["crop"][::-1]], height=.62)

<details><summary><b>What this means</b></summary>

**Profit per tile-day = (units × base price − seed cost) / tile-days occupied.** This is the
foundation of every planting decision.

- **Melon** looks most profitable on paper ($250 base, highest profit/tile-day), but it is a
  *one-shot* crop and its price cliff is steep (see §4) — planting too many destroys the value.
- **Tomato** has a low base price but yields continuously: steady cash flow. **Strawberry**
  yields continuously at a high price — it is the main crop of the top meta (§6).
- **Wheat** has thin margins but two hidden values: it feeds animals, and its price
  essentially never crashes (3000 units before hitting the floor, §4).

## 3. Yield curves: fertilizer is not optional

For one-shot crops, watering in the bonus window adds yield; fertilizer doubles
that. Here is what that does to wheat vs melon day by day.

## cell [7] — code

```python
def yield_curve(crop, water=True, fert=False):
    c, units, curve = CROPS[crop], 1, []
    w0 = (c["max_yield_day"] + 1) // 2
    for age in range(0, c["max_yield_day"] + 1):
        if water and w0 <= age <= c["max_yield_day"]:
            units = min(c["max_yield"], units + (2 if fert else 1))
        curve.append(units)
    return curve

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8.2, 3.1), sharey=True)
for ax, crop in zip(axes, ["WHEAT", "MELON"]):
    c = CROPS[crop]
    for fert, style, lbl in [(False, "-", "watered daily"), (True, "--", "watered + fertilized")]:
        curve = yield_curve(crop, fert=fert)
        ax.step(range(len(curve)), curve, style, where="post", color=CROP_C[crop], lw=2.2, label=lbl)
    ax.axhline(c["max_yield"], color="#4A3F35", lw=1, ls=":")
    ax.text(0.1, c["max_yield"] + .12, f"max {c['max_yield']}", fontsize=9)
    ax.set_title(crop.title()); ax.set_xlabel("days after planting")
    ax.legend(fontsize=9, loc="upper left", frameon=False)
axes[0].set_ylabel("units at harvest")
fig.suptitle("Fertilizer is the only road to max wheat; melon maxes out on water alone",
             fontsize=12, weight="bold", y=1.04)
plt.tight_layout(); plt.show()
```

**output:**

*[image omitted — see the notebook]*

## cell [8] — markdown

<details><summary><b>What this means</b></summary>

- **One-shot crops** (wheat / carrot / melon) gain +1 yield per watered day inside the
  bonus window; **fertilizer doubles that to +2/day**.
- **Wheat** cannot reach its 6-unit cap on watering alone — it **needs fertilizer**. So the
  seed's real value exceeds what the profit table shows.
- **Melon** reaches its 6-unit cap on watering alone by day 10; fertilizing melon is wasted
  — save the fertilizer for wheat.
- **Animals each produce 1 fertilizer per day** (a boolean, not a stockpile — uncollected
  dung is gone at day's end). That is the "raise animals, sell the fertilizer" free-money
  loop (§7 shows top games selling thousands of units).

## 4. The price cliff: why everyone meters sales

Premium goods (strawberry / milk / wool) crash from full price to the $1 floor
after ~100 units of oversupply. This is the single most important mechanic for
selling strategy. The shape of each curve comes straight from the engine.

## cell [10] — code

```python
invs = list(range(MARKET_I0 - 200, MARKET_I0 + 400))
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8.2, 3.6))

ax.set_title("Sell price vs market inventory — premium goods fall off a cliff")
ax.set_xlabel("market inventory"); ax.set_ylabel("sell price $")

plt.tight_layout(); plt.show()

# units to hit the $1 floor from equilibrium
def cliff_units(item):
    inv, sold = MARKET_I0, 0
    while market_price(item, inv) > 1 and sold < 3000:

    return sold

<details><summary><b>What this means</b></summary>

**Overselling drives the price from the 10,000 baseline toward the $1 floor.** How fast
depends entirely on the product:

| Product | Units to hit the floor | Crash shape |
|---|---|---|
| Wool / Strawberry / Milk | **~60-80 units** | Most fragile — one big dump zeroes them |
| Melon | ~158 units | Resilient early, but cumulative oversupply still crashes it |
| Tomato / Carrot | ~500-850 units | Gentle |
| Wheat / Egg | ~3000 units | **Essentially never crash** (ballast) |

**The response**: **small, metered batches** (4-8 units per order), selling more while the
price holds. Dumping everything at once means the first units earn a high price and the rest
sit on the $1 floor — you crash your own revenue. That is exactly the top selling rhythm you
will see in §7.

### 4b. Watch a price dump happen (animation)

Selling premium goods into a glut pushes the price down a cliff *while you are
still selling*. This is why metered sales matter — the first units earn far more
than the last ones. The animation below sells strawberries one at a time.

<details><summary><b>What this means</b></summary>

The animation sells strawberries *one at a time* into a saturated market. Two things to watch:

1. **The price crashes while you sell** — the first units earn $100+, the last earn $1. The
   revenue curve (right panel) flattens: **the first 50 units earn more than the next 100**.
2. **The takeaway**: never dump everything at once. Sell in batches while the price holds
   high (before opponents flood the market) to lift your **average realized price**. This is
   the core of the whole selling strategy.

## 5. Live meta: pick your slice of the ladder

The daily dataset ships a `manifest.csv` with each episode's **mean Ladder rating**
(`avg_score`). Set `MIN_ELO` / `MAX_ELO` to analyze any band of the ladder.

> **What is this Elo?** It is the agents' **Ladder rating** (the Elo ladder that runs
> daily games), **not** the leaderboard score you submit for. The ladder has many more
> agents than the leaderboard's top ~20 rows — on 8/5 about 1,200+ agents were rated
> 2800+, while the leaderboard shows far fewer. You don't need your exact ladder rating:
> just pick the band you want to study.
>
> - `MIN_ELO = 2900` → pure top tier (small sample, sharpest)
> - `MIN_ELO = 2800` → strong band, good sample (default)
> - `MIN_ELO = 2600, MAX_ELO = 2799` → a mid/your-neighborhood band
> - `MIN_ELO = 2500, MAX_ELO = 2699` → "climbing players" — what separates them from top
> - `MIN_ELO = None, MAX_ELO = None` → the whole day
>
> The median ladder rating is printed after selection, so you can see where your chosen
> slice sits relative to the day.

<details><summary><b>How to read any slice of the ladder</b></summary>

The official daily dataset ships a `manifest.csv` recording each episode's **mean Ladder
rating (avg_score)** — not the leaderboard score. Pick episodes by band — no count cap:

```python
MIN_ELO = 2800     # only episodes with avg Elo >= 2800 (lowest score to keep)
MAX_ELO = None     # highest score to keep; None = no upper bound
```

- `MIN_ELO=2800` → a strong band with a large sample; `MIN_ELO=2600, MAX_ELO=2799` → a lower
  band (e.g. your ladder neighborhood); both `None` → the whole day.
- The cell above also prints the **score distribution** of the selected slice (count / min /
  median / mean / max + a histogram) so you know exactly which part of the ladder you are
  looking at.
- The cell above also prints the **score distribution** of the selected slice (count / min /

<details><summary><b>What top farms look like</b></summary>

The **modal meta** is printed above the composition table (the `MODAL META` line) —
it is derived from *this* band's real data, so it updates every day you re-run
instead of going stale. The same farm keeps winning for a few *mechanical* reasons:

- **Animals pay more than crops.** Cows/sheep multiply output ~3-4x under daily CARE,
  and each animal drops **1 fertilizer/day** for free — farm animals are also the
  fertilizer business (§7).
- **Strawberry is the late-game earner.** It yields continuously at the highest
  sustainable price; a steady block of 6 keeps income high into day 30.
- **A little wheat for feed.** Cows eat wheat; growing some yourself keeps the herd
  profitable — hence the recurring **6 strawberry + 1 wheat** layout.
- **NE + SW, skip SE.** Land beyond the free NW tile costs 1k then 2k; the 4k SE tile

## 7. Sell timing: the strategy behind the farm

Given the price cliff, selling is metered. Here is the actual rhythm of the
selected band — first sale day and average batch per product.

## cell [22] — code

```python
# timing was aggregated during the streaming pass in §6 (one file at a time).
_timing = AGG_ALL["timing"]
print(f"{'item':12s} {'first_day':>9s} {'avg_batch':>9s} {'orders':>6s}")
for item, es in sorted(_timing.items()):
    days = [d for d, _ in es]; bs = [b for _, b in es]
    print(f"{item:12s} {min(days):9d} {sum(bs)/len(bs):9.1f} {len(es):6d}")
```

**output:**

```text
item         first_day avg_batch orders
CARROT               0       3.4    443
EGG                  0       7.7    408
FERTILIZER           2       3.4   1220
MELON                0       7.7   1220
MILK                 2       6.2   1220
STRAWBERRY           3       8.1   1220
TOMATO               0       4.1    408
WHEAT                0      14.2   1220
WOOL                 1       6.5   1220

<details><summary><b>The selling rhythm</b></summary>

Sell characteristics of top episodes (current Elo band):

| Product | First day | Avg batch | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wheat | day 0-5 | 7-8 | **Sold first** — feeds cows + cash flow |
| Melon | day 3-10 | 6-7 | Early capital; big sale around day 10 |
| Milk | day 8 | 8 | Steady once cows mature |
| Strawberry | day 11 | 8 | Main late-game earner |
| Wool | day 6 | 7 | Steady |
| Fertilizer | day 1 | 4-5 | **Free money**, sold daily |

**The pattern**: every product is sold in **small, steady batches, more while the price
holds**. Nothing is dumped in one go — that is the standard defense against the price cliff.
**The differentiation**: when everyone sells on this rhythm, **whoever acts first gets the
better price** — watch your opponent's maturation timing and sell before their big harvest.

<details><summary><b>Why you must track daily</b></summary>

The official index's `top_avg_score` / `median_avg_score` show the ladder evolving
explosively:

- **07-30 → 08-04**: median **670 → 2767** (4x in five days); top **1152 → 2996**
- The pace has slowed: 08-03 → 08-04 moved only +36/+37 — the meta is converging.

**Implication**: "yesterday's top strategy" can be mid-pack today. To stay relevant you need to:
1. **Pull the newest episodes daily** (re-run §5 on a fresh date)
2. **Watch your own rating neighborhood** (adjust `MIN_ELO` / `MAX_ELO`)
3. **Evolve with the meta** instead of clinging to one fixed "optimal farm"

### 4. Takeaway
no dominant farm yet — the band is experimenting; watch composition spread. strawberry batch avg 8.9 — sell in that rhythm, never dump.

## cell [29] — markdown

<a id="summary"></a>
## 9. Summary

### Key takeaways

1. **The meta is converged but still evolving.** Top farms are ~**8 cows + 5-6 sheep +
   6-7 strawberry, NE+SW land**. But the newest top tier has upgraded to **12 hands +
   6 strawberry + 1 wheat-for-feed**, vs the older 8-hand / 7-strawberry version.
   **Tracking the latest episodes matters.**
2. **Selling is metered.** Premium price curves are cliffs, so top players sell in
   **small batches (avg 4-8 units/order)** and **more while the price holds**.
3. **Fertilizer is free money.** The engine accepts `SELL FERTILIZER`, animals produce it
   daily — raising animals and selling the fertilizer is steady cash flow.
4. **Differentiation is in timing.** When everyone plays the same farm, **whoever sells into
   the shared market first gets the better price**. Watch your opponent's maturation rhythm
   and **sell before their big harvest**.

### Analyze any band of the ladder

Set the config at the top of §5 (`avg_score` = Ladder rating, not leaderboard):
```python
MIN_ELO = 2800    # only episodes with avg Elo >= 2800
MAX_ELO = None    # None = no upper bound
```
- `MIN_ELO=2800` → a strong band with a large sample; `MIN_ELO=2600, MAX_ELO=2799` → a lower
  band (e.g. your ladder neighborhood).
- Data comes from the **official daily dataset** — point at a fresh date and re-run to
  **track the meta every day**.

### Daily workflow
1. Point at the newest dataset. 2. Pick your Elo band. 3. Read the collective strategy /
   sell rhythm. 4. Differentiate against it.
